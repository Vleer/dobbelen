## 🎮 Game Rules

### Overview
Dobbelen is a variation of Liar's Dice that emphasizes strategic endurance. Players aim to outlast others by successfully navigating rounds without losing.

### Setup
- **Players**: 3-6 players (minimum 3 for meaningful gameplay)
- **Equipment**: Each player starts with 5 dice concealed under a cup
- **Start**: All players roll dice secretly, then play proceeds clockwise

### Gameplay Actions

#### 1. Raise
- Declare a new bid predicting how many dice show a specific face value
- Example: "Four threes" means at least four dice show the value 3
- New bids must either:
  - Increase the **quantity** (e.g., "Five twos" after "Four threes")
  - Increase the **face value** while maintaining/increasing quantity (e.g., "Four fours" after "Four threes")

#### 2. Doubt
- Challenge the previous player's bid
- All dice are revealed and counted
- If the bid was accurate/understated: **challenger is eliminated**
- If the bid was overstated: **previous bidder is eliminated**

#### 3. Spot On
- Claim the previous bid is exactly correct
- If exactly correct: **all other players are eliminated, you win the round**
- If incorrect: **you are eliminated**

### Winning
- **Round Winner**: Last player standing in a round
- **Game Winner**: Player who wins the most rounds (or first to reach target rounds)
- **Eliminated Players**: Return with full dice for the next round

### Strategy Tips
- **Calculated Risk**: Balance bold bids with realistic probabilities
- **Read Opponents**: Watch for bluffing patterns and uncertainty
- **Spot-On Tactics**: High-risk, high-reward moves that can win rounds instantly
- **Survival Mode**: Play conservatively to avoid elimination

## 🎯 How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Create or Join a Game**: Use the lobby to create a new game or join an existing one with a 3-character game ID
2. **Add Players**: Invite friends or add AI opponents to fill out your game (3-6 players recommended)
3. **Start Playing**: Once all players are ready, the host can start the game

### Game Interface
- **Your Dice**: View your 5 dice at the bottom of the screen
- **Opponents**: See other players' cups (dice hidden until revealed)
- **Current Bid**: The central display shows the current bid and whose turn it is
- **Actions**: Use the Raise, Doubt, or Spot On buttons when it's your turn
