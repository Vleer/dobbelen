## üéÆ Game Rules

### Liar's Dice Variation: "Endurance Round"

This variation of Liar's Dice introduces new mechanics to extend gameplay and emphasize strategic endurance.

---

### Objective

Players aim to outlast others by successfully navigating rounds without losing. The last player standing in a round wins that round.

---

### Setup

1. **Players:** Typically 3‚Äì6 players (minimum 3 players for meaningful dynamics).
2. **Dice and Cups:** Each player starts with 5 dice, concealed under a cup.
3. **Starting the Game:**

   * All players roll their dice secretly and view their results.
   * Dice remain hidden under the cups.
   * The game begins with any player, proceeding clockwise.

---

### Turns and Actions

On each turn, players must choose one of three options:

1. **Raise:**

   * The player declares a new bid that increases the claim.
   * The bid predicts how many dice across all players show a specific face value.
   * Example: "Four threes" means there are at least four dice showing a face value of three.
   * The new bid must either:

     * Increase the **quantity** of dice (e.g., "Five twos" after "Four threes").
     * Increase the **face value** while maintaining or increasing the quantity (e.g., "Four fours" after "Four threes").

2. **Doubt:**

   * The player doubts the previous bid, challenging its accuracy.
   * When challenged:

     * All players reveal their dice.
     * Dice showing the declared face value are counted to verify the bid.
     * If the bid was accurate or understated, the challenger is **eliminated** from the round.
     * If the bid was overstated, the previous bidder is **eliminated** from the round.
     * Play continues without the eliminated player.

3. **Spot On:**

   * The player claims the previous bid is exactly correct.
   * When this is declared:

     * All dice are revealed and counted.
     * If the bid is **exactly correct**, all other players are **eliminated** from the round, and the player making the "Spot On" claim wins the round.
     * If the bid is not exactly correct, the player who called "Spot On" is **eliminated**, and the round continues.

---

### Rounds and Progression

1. After a player is eliminated, the current round continues with the remaining players.
2. A round ends when only one player is left. This player is declared the **round winner**.
3. All players reset their dice for the next round, and a new game begins.

---

### Additional Rules

1. **Wild Ones:** Before the game starts, players can decide if ones are wild, acting as any face value.
2. **Eliminated Players:** Eliminated players sit out for the remainder of the current round but return for the next round with all dice.
3. **Game Winner:** The overall winner can be determined by counting how many rounds each player wins or by playing a fixed number of rounds.

---

### Strategies

1. **Calculated Risk:** Balancing bold bids with realistic probabilities.
2. **Reading Opponents:** Observing others' behaviors to detect bluffing or uncertainty.
3. **Spot-On Tactics:** Spot-on calls can be game-changing but require precision and courage.
4. **Survival:** Playing conservatively to avoid elimination while others take risks.

---

### Example Gameplay

1. **Initial Turn:**

   * Player A starts with: "Three twos."
   * Player B raises: "Four threes."
   * Player C raises: "Five twos."

2. **Doubt Example:**

   * Player D doubts Player C‚Äôs bid.
   * All dice are revealed. If fewer than five twos are present:

     * Player C is eliminated.
     * The game continues with Players A, B, and D.

3. **Spot-On Example:**

   * Player B declares "Spot On" after Player A‚Äôs bid of "Four fours."
   * All dice are revealed. If exactly four fours are present:

     * Player B wins the round immediately.
     * Otherwise, Player B is eliminated, and the round continues.

Table Layout (Container)

Base container:
A centered, responsive table container (e.g., <div class="game-table">) using flexbox or CSS grid.

Aspect ratio close to 4:3 or 16:9, to maintain a rectangular poker-table look.

Position: relative, so child elements (players, dice, UI controls) can be placed absolutely.

Player Positioning

Yourself (local player):

Positioned bottom center.

Container includes:

Dice row: 5 dice shown in order, horizontally aligned, fixed width per die.

Cup placeholder: a small closed-cup element next to dice, usually centered above them.

Username label: directly under the dice row.

Action controls (Raise, Doubt, Spot On): displayed just beneath the player area.

Opponent Left:

Positioned bottom left quadrant (rotated 90¬∞ orientation optional).

Displays cup only (closed).

Username placed under the cup.

Eliminated state: cup grayed out or semi-transparent.

Opponent Right:

Positioned bottom right quadrant, mirroring the left opponent.

Same structure: cup + username.

Opponent Across:

Positioned top center.

Cup is centered, username below.

Optional placeholder for dice revealed only at end-of-round.

Bid & Turn Information

Center overlay panel (like a pot in poker):

Shows current bid (e.g., ‚ÄúFour Threes‚Äù).

Displays turn indicator (highlight current player‚Äôs cup with a border or glow).

Updates via WebSocket /topic/game/{gameId}/bids events.

Event Handling Integration

bidUpdate ‚Üí update central bid display.

playerEliminated ‚Üí gray out opponent‚Äôs cup.
